## What this API for ?
I am creating this **API** for my next **current project** which is a platform (built with *ReactJS*) that includes a list of all the movies and series that I have watched, and I also provided a time tracker for each movie and series and the total time **I wasted watching these movies** ... so -To do this project, I need an API that provides me with all these things, so I build this a simple RESTful API to do this stuff
